ABOUT THIS SITE
===============

I have become rather the fan of a somewhat obscure Russian animated
series called "Nu, pogodi! (Russian: ÑNÑÖ, ÑÅÑÄÑsÑÄÑtÑy! (Well, just you wait!))
I've discovered it somewhat by accident when researching Russian animation
and artwork, and found that it's quite similar to Western cartoons like
Tom & Jerry and Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote in style, but the animation,
art style, and feel are distinctly Russian. Information is rather scarce
on this series, but I'll try my best with this site to bring that to you! :)

The whole purpose of this site is twofold: I'm working on this site as
a learning experience with HTML5 and CSS3, plus other web development
languages and tools, and to also share what knowledge I have gained about this
show with others. In that regard, I'm also gathering up other episodes of
the series (and also in HD where available) so that people can watch any
of them at their leisure, as well as provide info on each episode. There are 20
episodes to this series overall, and I intend to try to provide all of them
as streaming HTML5 video.

Feel free to play with the code and study it, however rudimentary it is in the
beginning, but please don't use it in a commercial work (at least, not right away!)
I may re-license later on down the road once this site looks a little nicer.

Enjoy the videos! :)
